     - Have a clear understading from Starteam POC's on the Data and design the data Migration.
     - Suggestions on the best practices and 
       
   - POC and Sample test repo Migration phase
   - Production Migration phase
   - Handover phase
   
3. **Data Assessment and Planning**
   - Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existing Starteam repository to identify all relevant data, including **users,permissions,LFS objects, commits, tags, releases, change sets, history, pull requests, and artifacts**.

5. **Data Extraction**
   - Extract all data, including Users, Permissions, LFS objects, commits, tags, releases, change sets, history, pull requests, artifacts and not limited to list from the Starteam repository.

6. **Data Transformation and Formatting**
   - Transform and format the extracted data to align with Github's structure and requirements, including maintaining commit history and relationships.

7. **Data Migration**
   - Migrate all data to the designated Github repository.

   - Ensure that all LFS objects are migrated, preserving their integrity and ensuring their proper tracking within Github LFS.

9. **Quality Assurance and Testing**
   - Conduct thorough testing to validate the migration process.
   - Verify that all data, including LFS, has been successfully migrated.
   - Address any issues or discrepancies identified during testing.

10. **Data Verification and Validation**
   - Collaborate with the client's team to verify the migrated data's accuracy and completeness.

11. **Training and Knowledge Transfer**
   - Provide training and documentation to the client's team on managing the migrated repository in Github.

11. **Documentation and Reporting**
    - Maintain detailed records of the migration process and provide a comprehensive migration report.

12. **Post-Migration Support**
    - Offer post-migration support to address any issues or questions that may arise after the migration.

### III. Deliverables

1. Detailed Migration Plan (Objectives, dependencies, Risks, Milestones and Timelines)
2. Test repos migration 5 repos and sign -off from POC 
3. Extracted and Transformed Data
4. Migrated Github Repository with all data
5. Testing and Validation Reports
6. Training and Run Book Documentation
7. Comprehensive Migration Report
8. Post-Migration Support

### IV. Change Control Process


### V. Timeline

The project timeline will be defined in the detailed migration plan, considering the size and complexity of the Starteam repository. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption.
